<DIV STYLE="TEXT-ALIGN:CENTER;"><h1><b>Optical illusions can be spotted everywhere</b></h1>    
<p style="font-size:22px;">the Taj Mahalwere masters of proportions 
and tricks of the eye. When you first approach the 
main <br>gate that frames the Taj, for example, the 
monument appears incredibly close and large. But <br>
as you get closer, it shrinks in size—exactly  the 
opposite of what <br>you’d expect. And although the  minarets surrounding 
the  tomb look perfectly upright, the  <br> towers  actually lean outward,
 which serves both form and function: <br>in addition providing 
aesthetic balance, the pillars would crumble away from the<br>
 main crypt in a disaster like an earthquake.</p></div>
    <DIV STYLE="TEXT-ALIGN:CENTER;">        <h2><B>The most famous myth is probably false</B></h2>
<P style="font-size:22px;">According to a popular legend, Shah Jahan wanted desperately for the <br>
mausoleum to be an exquisite masterpiece without an equal. To ensure no one<br>
 could recreate the Taj Mahal’s beauty, Shah Jahan supposedly severed the<br>
 hands and gouged the eyes of the artisans and craftsmen. Despite the prevalence <br>
of this gruesome tale, historians have found no evidence to support the story—though it does <br>
heighten the drama of the romantic tragedy.</P></div>
<DIV STYLE="TEXT-ALIGN:CENTER;"><h2><b>Both of the cenotaphs are empty</b></H3>
<P style="font-size:22px;">Inside thETaj Mahal, the cenotaphs honoring Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan are enclosed <br>in an 
eight-sided chamber ornamented with pietra dura (an inlay with<br> semi-precious stones) and a marble 
lattice screen. But the gorgeous monuments are just for show: The<br> real sarcophagi are in a quiet room 
below, at garden level.</P>
<h4><b>It changes color throughout the day</b></H4>
<P style="font-size:22px;">One of the allures of the Taj Mahal is its constantly changing hue. From <br>dawn to dusk, the sun transforms 
the mausoleum. It may seem pearly gray <br>and pale pink at sunrise, dazzling white at high noon, and an
 orange-bronze when the<br> sun sets. In the evenings, the Taj can appear translucent blue. Special tickets are<br>
 even sold for full moon and eclipse viewings.</p>
